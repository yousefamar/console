# Android app backlog

Working agreement: Yousef files singular bugs/features here (via any Claude session);
they get implemented + committed as they come, but a **release is cut only when
there's significant meat** — no rebuild per item. Committed-but-unreleased work sits
in "Built, awaiting release" until a version ships, then moves under that release.

## Open (not yet built)

## Built, awaiting release

- Map white void: style JSON was passed to setStyle(String) which treats it as a URI —
  silently never loaded. Now Style.Builder().fromJson(...).
- Mail undo toast → shared bottom UndoHost snackbar (small, bottom, consistent);
  UndoController gained onExpire cleanup hook (attachment eviction preserved)
- Mail grid badge = inbox thread count (SPA parity: triage-left, not unread count)
- WebView zero-height class of bug FIXED: a WebView inside verticalScroll measures 0
  (UNSPECIFIED max-height) and renders nothing. New shared SelfSizingWebView
  (ui/components/HtmlWebView.kt) sizes itself from renderer contentHeight (JS off);
  mail bodies + feeds full-text now use it. This was "anything involving webviews
  seems broken" — also why the Dark/Original toggle looked broken (body was invisible).
- Home Blog tab: hub emits FLOAT mtimes; longOrNull parsed null → all ages 1970. Now
  doubleOrNull. Canvas tab: domStorageEnabled=false made the canvas shell throw on
  localStorage and blank — enabled.
- Bookmark detail: "Preview page here" — embedded WebView (420dp, zoomable) renders the
  bookmarked URL in the sheet; collapsed by default.
- ONE permanent notification: Push/Glasses/Pen FGS all share notification id 1 via
  core/OngoingNotif ("Console · <push> · <glasses> · <pen>"); idle services contribute
  no line; stop uses STOP_FOREGROUND_DETACH so survivors keep the row. Glasses/Pen
  services no longer start at all when unpaired (PairStore gate; settings Scan
  force-starts for first-time pairing).
- Email Dark/Original preference persists app-wide (SharedPreferences)

# Android app backlog

Working agreement: Yousef files singular bugs/features here (via any Claude session);
they get implemented + committed as they come, but a **release is cut only when
there's significant meat** — no rebuild per item. Committed-but-unreleased work sits
in "Built, awaiting release" until a version ships, then moves under that release.

## Shipped

### v66 (2026-07-20)
- Context meter clamp (interim estimate could exceed window: "391k / 200k")
- Composer paste-image button folded into attach long-press

### v65 (2026-07-20)
- Bidirectional inbox membership sweep (missing inbox items: failed hydrates were treated as archives)
- Sentence auto-capitalization on all free-text inputs (composers, mail subject/body, notes, event fields, prompts)

### v64 (2026-07-20)
- Durable composer drafts (SharedPreferences DraftStore per chat room / agent session)
- Dead-thread inbox sweep (threads deleted outright on Gmail's side)
- Agent-text copy button removed → long-press message for Copy/Read-aloud sheet
- Remaining "queues offline" filler text removed

### v63 (2026-07-20)
- Map completely white (MapView.onCreate never called)
- NavHost cross-fade transitions removed
- Sync banner: pending vs failed split, tappable → outbox inspector; mail 404/410 label ops treated as done
- Agent streamed-text mangling (WS delta races → single-consumer channel; tool-input accumulator per toolUseId)
- Code fences: long-press-to-copy replaces button row
- Needs-me filter persistence
- PTT hardware key: agent chat open → composer dictation, else /mic/say to mic owner

### v62 (2026-07-20)
- Full FEATURES.md parity release (560 MISSING + 191 DEGRADED built)
